Lens started as a one man project by

* [Edward Kmett](mailto:ekmett@gmail.com) [@ekmett](https://github.com/ekmett)

However, it then languished for 3 years after Don Stewart released perfectly adequate bindings for yices.

It revived by

* [Johan Kiviniemi](mailto:lens@johan.kiviniemi.name) [@ion1](https://github.com/ion1)

who shamed the original into polishing it up and releasing it.

Thank you for all of your help!
